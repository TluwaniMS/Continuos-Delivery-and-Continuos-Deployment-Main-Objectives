# CONTINUOS DELIVERY AND CONTINUOS DEPLOYMENT MAIN-OBJECTIVES

* Creating a repeatable, reliable process for releasing software
* Enabling the continuos shipping of software to our users so we can get feedback faster and know what to improve.
* A way of working so that software is always in a releasable state
* Maximising the feedback loop:
  - To know if we are building things right.
  - To know whether we are building the right things.
* Main difference between `Continuos Delivery` and `Continuos Deployment`:
  - `Continuos Delivery` is more technically focused while `Continuos Deployment` is more product focused.
* Speed:
  - `Throughput` = `Lead Time` & `Frequency`
* Quality:
  - `Stability` = `Change Failure Rate` & `Recovery Failure Time`

`NB!`

Working in smaller steps to ensure that our software is always in a releasable state.


* What determines releasability ?
  - Code does what dev's expect it to do (Tests pass locally)
  - Code does what users want it to do (Acceptance tests)
  - System is nice and convenient to use (Acceptance tests)
  - System is fast enough (Acceptance tests)
  - System is scalable
  - System is secure, resilient, and compliant enough
